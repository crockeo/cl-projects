* bokbok

It's like [[https://github.com/crockeo/bok][bok]] except it's using a LISP 2 instead of a LISP 1...so bokbok?

** Live Editing

In order to live edit, you need to:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# start bokbok in a terminal window
make run
#+END_SRC

Within emacs, then you need to run ~slime-connect~ and choose the default
arguments:

- Host: ~localhost~
- Port: ~4005~

Then you should have your SDL2 window open AND also have

** Implementation Plan

- [x] SDL proof-of-concept
  - [X] Window system
  - [X] Event system (responding to keyboard)
  - [x] Blitting a texture on screen
- [X] SDL REPL
  - [X] Updates to SBCL iterative compilation => changes to SDL window
  - [X] Continuation on exception (resume SDL state from before the exception
    occurred)
- [-] Building
  - [X] Build an executable for local machine
  - [ ] Static linked executable
  - [ ] Cross-compiled static linked executable
