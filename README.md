# cl-projects

I had a bunch of half-finished Common Lisp projects. Instead of littering my
GitHub with them, I decided to collect them here. Each directory has its own
README.md that probably thinks it's its own project still.

## Dependencies

Each of these projects were written using SBCL 2.0.7. No promises about
cross-implementation or cross-version compatibility. Bonne chance!

## License

MIT Open Source. Refer to `LICENSE` for more details.
