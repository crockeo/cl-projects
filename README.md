# cl-projects

I had a bunch of half-finished Common Lisp projects. Instead of littering my
GitHub with them, I decided to collect them here. Each directory has its own
README.md that probably thinks it's its own project still.

## Projects

### [bokbok](/bokbok)

Draft of a 2D game engine written on top of SDL. Hosts a Swank server & finagles
the default cl-sdl2 event loop to support live editing of nearly everything.

### [cl-monthly-playlist](/cl-monthly-playlist)

A Spotify client wrapper and maybe one day monthly favorited songs
archiver. We'll see if we ever get there.

### [practical-common-lisp-exercises](/practical-common-lisp-exercises)

A collection of exercises written while reading [Practical Common
Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/). It's a great book, by the way. Read it
if you haven't.

## Dependencies

Each of these projects were written using SBCL 2.0.7. No promises about
cross-implementation or cross-version compatibility. Bonne chance!
